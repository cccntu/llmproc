# Current Error Handling Analysis in LLMProc

## Key Issues in Current Implementation

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas where the current error handling approach could be improved:

### 1. Inconsistent Error Handling Between Providers

**OpenAI Executor:**
```python
try:
    response = await process.client.chat.completions.create(...)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in OpenAI API call: {str(e)}")
    # Add error to run result
    run_result.add_api_call({"type": "error", "error": str(e)})
    process.run_stop_reason = "error"
    raise  # Simply re-raises without context
```

**Anthropic Executor:**
```python
# No try/except around API call
response = await process.client.messages.create(...)
```

The Anthropic executor lacks try/except blocks around API calls, while the OpenAI executor has them. This inconsistency means errors are handled differently depending on which provider is used.

### 2. Limited Error Information in Logs

Current error logs provide minimal context:
```python
logger.error(f"Error in OpenAI API call: {str(e)}")
```

This makes it difficult to correlate errors with specific requests or understand the context in which they occurred.

### 3. Loss of Original Exception Context

When re-raising errors, the OpenAI executor uses:
```python
raise  # Simply re-raises without additional context
```

This preserves the stack trace but doesn't add any additional context about what was happening when the error occurred.

### 4. No Retry Logic for Transient Errors

Neither provider implementation has retry logic for handling transient errors like rate limits or temporary service unavailability, which are common with API services.

### 5. Inconsistent Error Tracking in RunResult

The OpenAI executor adds error information to RunResult:
```python
run_result.add_api_call({"type": "error", "error": str(e)})
```

But this pattern isn't consistently applied across all error scenarios or providers.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I recommend a focused set of improvements that maintain code clarity while addressing the most critical issues:

1. **Add consistent try/except blocks around API calls** in all providers
2. **Implement basic retry logic with exponential backoff** for rate limiting and transient errors
3. **Enhance error logging** with more context but without making logs excessively verbose
4. **Improve error propagation** by preserving original exceptions with additional context
5. **Standardize error tracking in RunResult** across all providers

These improvements would maintain the clean architecture of the codebase while significantly improving reliability and debuggability.
