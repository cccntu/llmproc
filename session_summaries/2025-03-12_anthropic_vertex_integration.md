# LLMProc Enhancement Project Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the work completed to implement support for Anthropic and Google Vertex AI providers in the LLMProc library. The implementation was done in a dedicated git worktree branch called `feature/add-anthropic-vertex-support`.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Adding Direct Provider Support

The first phase focused on extending the `LLMProcess` class to support Anthropic's Claude models and Google Vertex AI's models (including Claude models via Vertex AI):

1. **API Client Integration**:
   - Added conditional imports for Anthropic and Vertex AI libraries
   - Implemented provider-specific client initialization 
   - Added error handling for cases when required packages are not installed

2. **Provider-Specific Execution Logic**:
   - Implemented dedicated run methods for each provider (`_run_openai()`, `_run_anthropic()`, `_run_vertex()`)
   - Mapped common parameters (temperature, max_tokens) to provider-specific formats
   - Added special handling for Claude models through Vertex AI, which use a different format

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Created example TOML configurations for both new providers
   - Updated the reference configuration with new provider details and parameters
   - Added comprehensive API parameters documentation

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Updated the `.env.example` file to include all necessary credentials
   - Added dependency requirements for Anthropic and Vertex AI

### Phase 2: Architectural Refactoring

After successfully implementing basic support, the code was refactored to improve maintainability and modularity:

1. **Provider Architecture**:
   - Created a `BaseProvider` abstract class defining the provider interface
   - Extracted provider-specific logic into separate modules
   - Implemented provider registry for easy extension

2. **Modularity Improvements**:
   - Simplified the main `LLMProcess` class by delegating to provider instances
   - Improved separation of concerns between configuration loading and execution
   - Made the system more extensible for future provider additions

3. **Provider Implementation Details**:
   - `OpenAIProvider`: Handles OpenAI API interaction
   - `AnthropicProvider`: Manages Claude model communication
   - `VertexProvider`: Supports both Claude models and native Vertex AI models

## Key Files Modified/Created

- **Core Implementation**:
  - `src/llmproc/llm_process.py`: Refactored to support multiple providers
  - `src/llmproc/providers/`: New directory containing provider implementations

- **Provider Files**:
  - `src/llmproc/providers/base.py`: Abstract provider interface
  - `src/llmproc/providers/openai_provider.py`: OpenAI implementation
  - `src/llmproc/providers/anthropic_provider.py`: Anthropic implementation
  - `src/llmproc/providers/vertex_provider.py`: Vertex AI implementation

- **Configuration Files**:
  - `examples/anthropic.toml`: Example config for Anthropic provider
  - `examples/vertex.toml`: Example config for Vertex AI provider
  - `examples/reference.toml`: Updated reference with all providers

- **Documentation**:
  - `api_parameters.md`: Comprehensive API parameter documentation

- **Requirements**:
  - Updated with `anthropic>=0.6.0` and `google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.35.0`

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies
- Parameter mapping between different provider formats
- Clear error messages for misconfiguration

Future work should include:
- Adding comprehensive unit tests for each provider
- Integration tests with actual API calls (with appropriate mocking)
- Documentation examples for each provider

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds support for both Anthropic and Vertex AI providers while improving the overall architecture of the codebase. The modular design now allows for easy addition of new providers in the future.

The code is now ready for review and testing before merging into the main branch.
