# Session Summary: Code Restructuring and Error Handling (2025-03-13)

## Overview
This session focused on a major code restructuring effort to improve modularity, maintainability, and error handling. The primary work involved reorganizing the provider implementations into a structured package and implementing more robust error handling for API calls.

## Key Accomplishments

### Code Restructuring
1. **Provider Package Organization**:
   - Moved provider implementations from a single file to a structured package
   - Created `src/llmproc/providers/` directory 
   - Relocated `providers.py` into the new package structure
   - Added proper package initialization and imports

2. **Anthropic Tool Handling Refactoring**:
   - Extracted Anthropic tool execution logic into dedicated module `anthropic_tools.py`
   - Simplified and clarified the tool execution workflow
   - Reduced complexity in the main `llm_process.py` file
   - Improved maintainability by separating provider-specific logic

3. **Import Compatibility**:
   - Implemented backward compatibility for existing code in `providers/__init__.py`
   - Fixed provider imports in test files to work with the new structure
   - Updated test imports in `test_mcp_features.py` and `test_providers.py`
   - Ensured all tests pass with the new module structure

### Error Handling Improvements
1. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error handling for all LLM API calls
   - Implemented proper validation for message content
   - Fixed empty text blocks bug in Anthropic API messages
   - Added context-rich error messages with file paths for easier debugging

2. **Debugging Infrastructure**:
   - Created `debug_dumps` directory for error logging
   - Implemented message content dumping to debug files on errors
   - Added capture of exact API parameters for troubleshooting
   - Improved diagnostics for API-related failures

### Documentation and Configuration
1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Enhanced `PHILOSOPHY.md` with kernel/Unix process analogy
   - Updated repository roadmap
   - Updated `repo-map.txt` to reflect the new directory organization

2. **Configuration Improvements**:
   - Updated MCP configuration in `config/mcp_servers.json`
   - Added Claude Code configuration example in `examples/claude_code.toml`
   - Added Claude Code system prompt template

## Technical Details
- Maintained compatibility with existing code through careful refactoring
- Improved code organization by following package-based structure
- Enhanced error handling with specific focus on API communication errors
- Reduced complexity in the main `llm_process.py` file by extracting provider-specific logic
- Fixed a specific bug related to empty text blocks in Anthropic API messages

## Next Steps
- Continue improving MCP tool handling with more robust error recovery
- Implement prompt caching (added to implementation roadmap)
- Further optimize API call patterns for better performance
- Expand testing for edge cases in tool execution

This restructuring establishes a more maintainable foundation for the project while significantly improving error handling and debugging capabilities.
