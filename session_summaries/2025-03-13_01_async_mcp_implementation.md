# LLMProc Session Summary - March 13, 2025

## Feature Implementation: MCP Tool Integration with Unified Async API

Today's session focused on improving the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation in LLMProc, specifically making it fully functional with proper asynchronous support.

### Changes Made

1. **Unified Async API**
   - Converted `run()` method to be fully asynchronous
   - Added automatic event loop detection and handling
   - Implemented transparent API for both sync and async contexts
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

2. **MCP Tool Implementation**
   - Fixed multi-turn tool execution for Anthropic models
   - Improved tool response handling and error management
   - Added debug_tools parameter for detailed logging of tool execution
   - Fixed state management during tool call iterations

3. **Provider Updates**
   - Updated all providers to use their async client variants
   - Added proper async support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Vertex AI
   - Improved client initialization and API interaction

4. **CLI Integration**
   - Updated CLI to work with the new async run() method
   - Made sure MCP tools can be used from the command line
   - Added tool discovery and execution to interactive sessions

5. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Simplified example files by removing redundant scripts
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new unified async API
   - Added detailed MCP status documentation
   - Created comprehensive usage examples for both sync and async contexts

6. **Testing**
   - Added tests for async tool execution
   - Updated existing tests to work with new async methods
   - Ensured all tests pass with the unified API
   - Added proper error handling in test scenarios

### Implementation Details

The feature implements a unified API that works transparently in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts:

```python
# In asynchronous context:
async def example():
    llm = LLMProcess.from_toml("examples/mcp.toml")
    response = await llm.run("Search for information about Python")
    print(response)

# In synchronous context:
llm = LLMProcess.from_toml("examples/mcp.toml")
response = llm.run("Search for information about Python")
print(response)
```

The implementation automatically detects the execution context and handles the event loop appropriately, creating one if needed in synchronous contexts.

For MCP tool support, the following TOML configuration is used:

```toml
[mcp]
config_path = "config/mcp_servers.json"

[mcp.tools]
github = ["search_repositories", "get_file_contents"]
codemcp = ["ReadFile"]
```

### Next Steps

Planned enhancements for future sessions:

1. Implement OpenAI provider support for MCP tools
2. Add more comprehensive integration tests
3. Implement caching for tool results
4. Add support for persistent tool state across conversation turns
5. Improve documentation with multi-provider examples

### Closing Thoughts

The unified async API with MCP tool support significantly enhances LLMProc's capabilities, allowing seamless integration with external tools while maintaining a clean, consistent API for developers. The implementation handles the complexities of asynchronous programming automatically, making it accessible to both async-aware and traditional synchronous code.
