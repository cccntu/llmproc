# Environment-Aware LLM Program Example
# Demonstrates how to use environment information to make LLMs context-aware

#-------------------------------------------
# Basic Model Configuration
#-------------------------------------------
[model]
name = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
provider = "anthropic" 
display_name = "Environment-Aware Assistant"

#-------------------------------------------
# System Prompt with Environment Awareness
#-------------------------------------------
[prompt]
system_prompt = """You are a helpful assistant with access to environment information.
When responding to questions about the user's environment, refer to the environment
variables provided in the <env> tags in your system prompt.

The environment information helps you understand the context of the user's queries
and provide more relevant responses. You can use this information to:

1. Provide system-specific advice (based on platform)
2. Reference the user's working directory in file operations
3. Make date-aware recommendations
4. Reference custom contextual information about the user's project

Always be transparent about which environment information you're using in your responses.

# Environment Information Configuration
#-------------------------------------------
[env_info]
# OPTION 1: Enable specific standard variables (list format)
# This is the recommended approach - only include what you need
variables = [
    "working_directory",  # Current directory path
    "platform",           # Operating system (darwin, linux, windows)
    "date",               # Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    "python_version"      # Python interpreter version
]

# OPTION 2: Enable all standard variables
# Uncomment to include all available standard variables
# variables = "all"

# OPTION 3: Disable environment information (default behavior)
# variables = []

# NOTE: Only system-defined variables are supported.
# Custom variables are not allowed in the env_info section.

# NOTE: Environment information is added to the system prompt in an <env> XML block
# It looks like this:
# <env>
# working_directory: /Users/username/projects/llmproc
# platform: darwin
# date: 2025-03-19
# python_version: 3.12.4
# </env>
