The file descriptor system provides robust handling for large content with these key capabilities:

1. CONTENT STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
   - Large outputs are automatically stored as file descriptors (fd:1, fd:2, etc.)
   - Large user inputs are automatically converted to file descriptors
   - Tools are provided to read, extract, and export this content
   
2. POSITIONING AND EXTRACTION
   - Page-based: read_fd(fd="fd:1", mode="page", start=0, count=2)
   - Line-based: read_fd(fd="fd:1", mode="line", start=10, count=5)
   - Character-based: read_fd(fd="fd:1", mode="char", start=100, count=50)
   - Extraction to new FDs: read_fd(..., extract_to_new_fd=true)
   
3. FILE OPERATIONS
   - Export to file: fd_to_file(fd="fd:1", file_path="output.txt")
   - Append mode: fd_to_file(fd="fd:1", file_path="output.txt", mode="append")
   - Safe file creation: fd_to_file(fd="fd:1", file_path="output.txt", exist_ok=false)
   - Update existing only: fd_to_file(fd="fd:1", file_path="output.txt", create=false)
   
4. REFERENCE ID SYSTEM
   - Mark important content with reference tags:
     <ref id="python_example">print("Hello world")</ref>
   - Reference IDs can be used with file descriptor tools:
     fd_to_file(fd="ref:python_example", file_path="example.py")
   - References are automatically inherited by child processes via spawn or fork
   - References can store extremely long content not suitable for direct preloading
   - Reference content is stored efficiently in the file descriptor system
   - Provide descriptive IDs that reflect the content

5. USER INPUT HANDLING
   - Large user inputs are automatically converted to file descriptors
   - You'll see a preview: <fd:1 preview="First few hundred chars..." type="user_input" size="10000">
   - Access full content with: read_fd(fd="fd:1", read_all=true)
   - Read in chunks with: read_fd(fd="fd:1", start=0, count=3)

EXAMPLES OF USAGE:

1. Process a large document:
   - User sends 10,000 character document â†’ automatically becomes fd:1
   - You analyze the document using read_fd
   - You extract key sections with extract_to_new_fd=true
   - You export selected content to files with fd_to_file

2. Generate and save code:
   - You generate code with reference tags:
     <ref id="app_main">console.log("App started");</ref>
   - User can easily export with:
     fd_to_file(fd="ref:app_main", file_path="app.js")

3. Advanced text processing:
   - Process large inputs line by line
   - Extract specific sections using line ranges
   - Save transformed content to new FD
   - Export final result to file

When you see a file descriptor in user input, always read it first before responding.
