# LLMProc Session Summary - March 13, 2025

## Feature Implementation: File Preloading

Today's session focused on implementing a new file preloading feature that allows users to provide file content as context to LLMs through the LLMProc framework.

### Changes Made

1. **Core Implementation**
   - Added preload_files parameter to LLMProcess.__init__
   - Implemented _preload_files method for loading file content
   - Updated from_toml method to parse preload section in TOML files
   - Enhanced reset_state method to optionally preserve preloaded content

2. **XML Formatting**
   - Implemented XML-tagged format for preloaded file content
   - Added XML-formatted warnings for missing files
   - Created a structure that allows multiple files to be combined in a single message

3. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Created preload.toml example to demonstrate the feature
   - Updated reference.toml with preload section documentation
   - Added detailed documentation in docs/preload-feature.md
   - Enhanced example.py to showcase preload functionality

4. **Testing**
   - Updated tests to handle the new feature
   - Ensured all tests pass with the new implementation
   - Verified functionality with example script

### Implementation Details

The feature adds a new `[preload]` section to TOML configuration files that allows users to specify a list of files to preload:

```toml
[preload]
files = [
  "path/to/file1.txt",
  "path/to/file2.md"
]
```

File paths are relative to the TOML file location. During initialization, LLMProc reads these files and adds their content to the conversation state with XML tags:

```xml
<preload>
<file path="file1.txt">
Content of file1.txt
</file>
<file path="file2.md">
Content of file2.md
</file>
</preload>
```

The enhanced reset_state method includes a new parameter `keep_preloaded` that determines whether to preserve preloaded content after a conversation reset.

### Next Steps

Potential enhancements to consider in future sessions:

1. Support for different preload formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, code)
2. Support for web URLs in addition to file paths
3. Ability to specify content format overrides
4. Chunking of large files to fit context windows
5. Selective loading of file sections

### Closing Thoughts

The preload feature significantly enhances LLMProc's capabilities by allowing it to incorporate file context at initialization. This enables richer conversations with better context awareness, particularly useful for domain-specific applications and knowledge-intensive tasks.
